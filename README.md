This is a simple parser I created to aid me with a module at Uni.

How to use:
	
	Enter desired filename. DO NOT include extensions. The script will add .img as default.
	Run the python script and type the string you wish to be read from Logisim memory and displayed on the TTY.
	If you wish to include a line break then just type "\n" as you would normally in Python.
	Go to Logisim and 'load image' into memory.
	If this memory containing the newly created image is hooked up to a TTY; when run it will display the text on the TTY.
